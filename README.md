# Cherry-interactive-Robot
A smart, interactive surveillance robot designed for home safety, automation, and AI assistance. It features real-time monitoring, voice-controlled IoT, emergency alerts, and intelligent image tracking using OpenCV. Equipped with gas, fire, motion, and temperature sensors, it ensures security even when the user is away.

This project introduces a smart, interactive surveillance robot designed to enhance home safety and
automation. Functioning as a multi-purpose home assistant, the robot integrates real-time
monitoring via an onboard camera, ensuring the safety of children, elderly members, and
property—even in the homeowner’s absence. It features emergency response capabilities, including
instant hospital alerts during critical situations, and serves as a centralized IoT hub, enabling voicecontrolled management of lights, fans, and other smart devices.
Equipped with voice interaction and web-scraping functionality, the robot acts as an intelligent
assistant, fetching information and executing commands. Its advanced safety mechanisms include
gas leakage detection, fire alerts, temperature monitoring, and intrusion detection. When the home
is unoccupied, the robot activates security mode, using motion sensors to detect anomalies and
immediately notifying users via mobile alerts. By combining AI-driven assistance, environmental
sensing, and proactive surveillance, this system delivers a comprehensive smart-home security
solution.
The robot also incorporates image tracking capabilities using OpenCV, enabling it to identify and
follow specific individuals or objects within the home. This feature is especially useful for tracking
the movement of children or elderly persons, ensuring their safety by keeping them within the
camera's view. The integration of computer vision technology allows the robot to intelligently
respond to visual cues in its environment, enhancing its ability to monitor, assist, and protect in
real-time
